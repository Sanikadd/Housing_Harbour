Finding the right home is tough without personalized recommendations and efficient filters on housing platforms.
Many people, especially newcomers or those with specific preferences, face frustration and inefficiency in their search.
A smarter housing locator system is necessary to simplify this process.
By using dynamic filters and considering user preferences, this system can offer tailored recommendations based on desired locations and individual criteria, making the search for a new home smoother and wiser.
