# Housing_Harbour
The smart housing locator system project involves making it easier to find a place to live by using advanced technology like data processing and machine learning. Here's how it works:

First, we gather and prepare all the relevant information we need, like property listings and what people are looking for in a place to live. We clean up the data and make sure it's useful.

Next, we use special techniques to make sense of the data, like figuring out what features are important and making everything consistent. This helps us make better recommendations later on.

Then, we pick and use algorithms (like k-Nearest Neighbors) to help us recommend properties to people. We train these algorithms using the cleaned-up data to make sure they work well.

We check to make sure everything is working right by testing our recommendations with different sets of data. This helps us know if our system is accurate and reliable before we let people use it.

The part that people interact with (the frontend) is made to look good and be easy to use. The technical part (the backend) handles all the heavy lifting, like dealing with the server and keeping track of data.

We use special tools like Flask and scikit-learn to help us build the system. These tools make it easier for us to do things like processing data and making recommendations based on what people want.

Overall, our system makes it much simpler for people to find a place to live by giving them personalized recommendations and helpful features. We're always working to make it better based on what users tell us and what we learn from the data.
